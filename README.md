## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Get Your Credentials

#### Spotify (Easy)
1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Create an app, copy Client ID and Secret
3. Add redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`

#### Qobuz (Use HAR File - Recommended)
1. Open https://play.qobuz.com and login
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
3. Play a song or browse playlists
4. Right-click in Network tab → "Save all as HAR"
5. Save as `qobuz.har`
6. Run: `python extract_token_from_har.py qobuz.har`

See [GET_TOKEN_INSTRUCTIONS.md](GET_TOKEN_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed steps.

### 3. Configure credentials.md

```markdown
## Spotify
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback

## Qobuz
QOBUZ_USER_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### 4. Test Your Setup

```bash
# Test Qobuz token
python test_token.py

# Dry run (see what would happen, no changes made)
python -m src.sync_service --dry-run true
```

### 5. Run the Sync!

```bash
python sync.py
```

That's it! Your playlists will be synced to Qobuz with the suffix "(from Spotify)".

## 🔄 Running Again (No Duplicates!)

**You can run the sync as many times as you want** - it won't create duplicates!

```bash
python sync.py
```

What happens:
- ✅ Finds existing playlists in Qobuz
- ✅ Checks which tracks are already there
- ✅ Only adds NEW tracks
- ✅ Skips duplicates
- ✅ Updates playlists if you added songs to Spotify

Example output:
```
Found existing playlist with 39 tracks, will add missing tracks only
Playlist sync complete: 80s - 40/43 tracks matched, 35 already in playlist
```

See [DUPLICATE_PREVENTION.md](DUPLICATE_PREVENTION.md) for technical details.

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Sync Playlists
```bash
# Interactive mode with confirmation
python sync.py

# Direct sync
python -m src.sync_service
```

### Sync One Playlist
```bash
# Sync one Spotify playlist by exact name
python -m src.sync_service --playlist-name "Playlist Name"

# Or sync by Spotify playlist ID when names are duplicated
python -m src.sync_service --playlist-id 37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
```

This uses the same duplicate prevention as the full playlist sync: if
`"Playlist Name (from Spotify)"` already exists in Qobuz, only missing tracks are
added. If multiple Spotify playlists have the same name, use `--playlist-id`.

### Sync Favorites
```bash
# Sync your Spotify saved tracks to Qobuz favorites
python sync_favorites.py

# Dry run to see what would be synced
python sync_favorites.py --dry-run

# Re-sync all favorites (even if already favorited)
python sync_favorites.py --no-skip-existing
```

### Dry Run (Test Mode)
```bash
# Playlists - see what would happen without making changes
python -m src.sync_service --dry-run true

# Favorites - see what would be synced
python sync_favorites.py --dry-run
```

### Force Create New Playlists
```bash
# Create new playlists even if they exist (will create duplicates)
python -m src.sync_service --update-existing false
```

### Custom Credentials File
```bash
# Playlists
python -m src.sync_service --credentials my_creds.md

# Favorites
python sync_favorites.py --credentials my_creds.md
```

### Custom Log File
```bash
python -m src.sync_service --log-file my_sync.log
```

### Retry Failed Syncs
```bash
# Retry one playlist by exact Spotify playlist name
python -m src.sync_service --playlist-name "Playlist Name"

# Analyze the latest log file and retry playlists that had errors
python retry_failed_syncs.py --dry-run true

# Actually retry the failed playlists
python retry_failed_syncs.py --dry-run false

# Specify a specific log file to analyze
python retry_failed_syncs.py --log-file sync_logs/sync_20251114_215703.log --dry-run false
```

This feature automatically:
- Parses log files to identify playlists with errors (timeouts, connection issues, etc.)
- Retries only those playlists that had problems
- Saves time by not re-syncing successful playlists

## 📈 What to Expect

The playlist sync service is safe for normal use and repeat runs. By default it
updates existing Qobuz playlists instead of creating duplicates, then adds only
tracks that are missing.

### First Sync
- **121 playlists synced** (example from real usage)
- **5,016 tracks matched** (89.25% success rate)
- **4,847 ISRC matches** (instant, perfect matches)
- **169 fuzzy matches** (name/artist/duration matching)
- **604 tracks not found** (missing from Qobuz catalog)
- **Time:** ~1.5 hours for 121 playlists

### Second Sync (Update)
- Finds all 121 existing playlists
- Checks existing tracks
- Adds only new tracks since last sync
- Leaves existing tracks untouched
- **Much faster** - only processes new tracks

## 🎯 How Track Matching Works

1. **ISRC Match (Best)** - Uses International Standard Recording Code
   - Instant, exact match
   - ~96% of tracks have ISRC codes
   - Most reliable method

2. **Fuzzy Match (Fallback)** - Uses title, artist, duration
   - RapidFuzz algorithm (Levenshtein distance)
   - Matches similar spellings, feat. variations
   - Score threshold: 85+

3. **Not Found** - Track doesn't exist in Qobuz catalog
   - Logged in missing tracks report
   - Saved to JSON for review

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Token Invalid/Expired
```
❌ Invalid or expired Qobuz token
```

**Solution:** Get a new token using the HAR file method:
1. Visit https://play.qobuz.com (login)
2. F12 → Network tab → Play a song
3. Right-click → "Save all as HAR"
4. Run: `python extract_token_from_har.py qobuz.har`
5. Update `credentials.md`

Test your token:
```bash
python test_token.py
```

### Spotify Authentication Failed
```
INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI
```

**Solution:** Make sure redirect URI is exactly:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
```
(Use `127.0.0.1` NOT `localhost`)

### Duplicate Playlists Created
If you accidentally created duplicates:

1. **Manually delete** duplicate playlists in Qobuz web player
2. **Next sync will update** the remaining playlists (no more duplicates)

The default `--update-existing true` prevents this.

### Token Expiration
Qobuz tokens typically last **days to weeks**. Test before syncing:
```bash
python test_token.py
```
